            Hello, I hope this day finds you well!
        </p>
        <p>
            I've been researching the art of game production for awhile, and I've come to formulate some new strategies for game design and development. 
        </p>
        <p>
            I believe, first and foremost, that access to game production should be expanded as widely as possible. Diversity is essential to progressing our collective understanding of humanity and our existence, and with this can come a brighter world.
        </p>
        <p>
            In light of this, I'd like to donate a modern Game Design Document to the world, free of charge. This document can be used for personal, educational, or commercial use, royalty-free under Creative Commons license CC BY-ND 4.0 Deed.

            This is a comprehensive <em>32-page Game Design Document</em> that covers most aspects of present-day game production. It's compiled from research and best practices in design and production from various fields.
